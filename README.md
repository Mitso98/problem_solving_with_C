        C Program to print Hexa of a number

        C Program to make simple calculations (add, sub, multiply, divid) on two integers

        C Program to compute Quotient and Remainder

    - Lab 2:
        1- Write a C program to check whether a given number is positive or negative or zero

        2- Write a C program to check whether a given number is even or odd

        3- C Program to Find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers

        4- Write a program that reads a student grade percentage and prints "Excellent"
            if his grade is greater than or equal 85, "Very Good" for 75 or greater; "Good" for 65,
            "Pass" for 50, "Fail" for less than 50

        5-Write a program to make a simple calculator using switch-case.
            The calculator takes the operation (+ or â€“ or * or /) and takes the two input arguments and print the results

    - Lab 3:
        1- Receive numbers from the user, and exit when the sum exceeds 100.

        2- Simple Menu with 3 choices.

        3- Magic Box.

        4- Write a function takes 3 numbers as parameter, and returns the largest one among them... write a program to test it.

        5- Write a C Function that takes one character and checks if it alphabet or not.

        6- Write C Function that converts the any letter from lowercase to uppercase.

        7-Write a C Function that prints the cube of any number.

        8- C Program to Generate Multiplication Table "1*3=3, 2*3=6, ..."

        9- C Program to count number of Alphabets & number of words in a sentence. (word count)

    - Lab 4:
        C Program to swap 2 integer values. (Swap function, calling by address)

        Receive character by character and then place the string terminator upon pressing enter, then display the string.

        C Program to take char and displays if it is "Normal or Extended key" along with its Ascii value.

        C Program to take firstName and lastName from user, then displays fullName.

        C Program to Find the Frequency of Characters in a String

        C Program to Copy String Without Using strcpy()

        C Program to Find the Length of a String without Using strlen()

        C Program to Remove all Characters in a String Except Alphabet

        Highlight Menu: New Colored Menu "with Arrows"

    - Lab 5

        1- C Program to take single Employee's information(ID, Name, Salary, Bonus, Deduction)
        , and display his code, name along with his net salary. (Emp_Struct)

        2- C Program to take information of Array of 5 Employees, then display their data. (EmpArr_of_Struct)

        3- Employee with Functions (try to divide Ass#2 into 2 functions):
        struct Employee AddNewEmployee();
        void DisplayEmployee(struct Employee);

        4- Employee with functions and Highlight Menu: Menu of Array_Of_Struct

    - Lab 6
        1) Input and Output from Array using pointers:
        C Program that have an Array of integers, read array data from user, Ptr -> Arr, print that array using Ptr.
        (try to use "Array Notation while reading data" and "Pointer notation while printing data")

        2) Recursive: Power.

    - Lab 7
        1. int* IncrementArray()
        - try to return fixed Array first, see what happened.
        - then rerun dynamically allocated array.


        2. Employee with Dynamic Allocation and Highlight Menu (allow the user to specify the size of array at runtime).


        3. C Program to calculate sum of student degrees, and average of each subject, asks the user for
        students and subject numbers. (Dynamic Allocation of 2D Array - Pointer to Pointer)

    - Bounes:
        Single line editor with backspace
